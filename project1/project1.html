        <blockquote>
            A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program 
            that outputs "Hello, World!" on a display device. 
            Being a very simple program in most programming languages, 
            it is often used to illustrate to beginning programmers the 
            basic syntax for constructing a working program. It is also
            used to verify that a language or system is operating correctly.
